A cryptarithmetic puzzle, or "cryptarithm," is an arithmetic problem made up of words. To solve
the problem, find a digit for each letter so that the problem is correct, and
so that no two letters represent the same digit. For example, the most famous
cryptarithm is:

```
  S E N D
+ M O R E
=========
M O N E Y
```

This Java Applet finds all possible solutions to cryptarithms. Type "send+more=money"
into the "Formula" box and hit the "Solve" button! Other
favorites: "small - dough = deal," "two \* six = twelve"
and "foot + foot + foot = yard." Have fun!

If answers are flying by too fast, try increasing the "delays." For
instance, try setting "After solution" two 500 (one-half second) and
see what happens.

The "After rejection" delay is set to 1 millisecond because on some
machines when it's set to 0 you can't see the digits flipping, which is the
most fun part of the whole thing. Try setting it to 0, and if you still see
the digits flip it will speed things up a bit.
